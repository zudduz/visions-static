<h1>Terms of Service for Chicken Scratch</h1>
<p><strong>Last Updated: January 16, 2026</strong></p>

<p>By inviting the bot, playing our games (including <em>The Foster Protocol</em>), or purchasing "Scratch", you agree to these terms. If you don't agree, please do not play.</p>

<h3>1. "Scratch" (Virtual Currency)</h3>
<p>We sell a virtual currency called "Scratch" that allows you to initiate game sessions and utilize AI features.</p>
<ul>
    <li><strong>No Ownership:</strong> "Scratch" has no real-world monetary value. You do not "own" the Scratch in your wallet. You are purchasing a limited, non-transferable, revocable license to use the software.</li>
    <li><strong>Consumable Nature:</strong> Scratch is a "consumable" item. Once it is used to start a game or trigger an AI response, it is permanently deducted from your account.</li>
    <li><strong>No Refunds:</strong> All sales of Scratch are final. We do not offer refunds for unused or used Scratch unless required by law or the specific platform's policy (e.g., Discord's Terms of Sale).</li>
</ul>

<h3>2. Code of Conduct</h3>
<p>We want a safe, fun environment. We reserve the right to ban any user from the service for:</p>
<ul>
    <li>Harassment, hate speech, or abuse towards other players or the developers.</li>
    <li>Attempting to hack, exploit, or disrupt the bot's operation.</li>
    <li>Abusing the AI (e.g., trying to "jailbreak" the bot to generate forbidden content).</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Consequence:</strong> If you are banned, you forfeit any remaining Scratch associated with your account.</p>

<h3>3. Service Availability (The "Indie" Clause)</h3>
<p>Chicken Scratch is an experimental project powered by third-party AI APIs.</p>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Uptime:</strong> We do not guarantee 100% uptime. The bot may go offline for maintenance, or because the AI provider is down.</li>
    <li><strong>AI Unpredictability:</strong> AI models can sometimes hallucinate or break. We are not responsible if the bot says something weird or if a game round ends unexpectedly due to an API error.</li>
    <li><strong>Termination:</strong> We reserve the right to shut down the service at any time.</li>
</ul>

<h3>4. Limitation of Liability</h3>
<p>To the maximum extent permitted by law, Chicken Scratch and its developers are not liable for any direct, indirect, incidental, or consequential damages arising from your use of the service. Play at your own risk.</p>

<h3>5. Contact</h3>
