<h1>Privacy Policy for Chicken Scratch</h1>
<p><strong>Last Updated: January 16, 2026</strong></p>

<p>Hi. This isn't a 50-page legal document written by a corporate team. Chicken Scratch is an experimental indie game platform powered by AI. We believe in being transparent about what we’re doing with your data, because trust is the best foundation.</p>

<p>Here is exactly what happens when you play our games (like <em>The Foster Protocol</em>).</p>

<h3>1. The Information We Collect</h3>
<p>To make the game work, we have to store a few things:</p>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Discord Information:</strong> We store your Discord User ID and Username. This allows the game to know who you are, keep track of your save file, and let the bots address you by name.</li>
    <li><strong>Game Inputs & Chat Logs:</strong> When you type a command or chat with a bot, we record that text.</li>
    <li><strong>Game State:</strong> We track your inventory, health, and decisions to keep the game running.</li>
</ul>

<h3>2. Where Your Data Goes (The AI Part)</h3>
<p>This is an AI-driven game. That means your messages don't just stay on our server.</p>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Third-Party AI Models:</strong> When you talk to a bot, your message is sent to external AI providers (currently <strong>Google Gemini</strong>, but we may test others in the future) to generate a response.</li>
    <li><strong>What this means:</strong> By playing, you agree that your game inputs are being processed by these third-party services. We do not control how they train their models.</li>
</ul>

<h3>3. How We Store It</h3>
<ul>
    <li><strong>The Database:</strong> We use <strong>LangGraph</strong> and our own internal databases to store your game history. This allows the bots to "remember" what you said five minutes ago.</li>
    <li><strong>Retention:</strong> Currently, we store game logs indefinitely to help us debug the game and improve the narrative experience.</li>
</ul>

<h3>4. How to Delete Your Data</h3>
<p>We are still building the "Self-Destruct" button. Right now, we do not have an automated way for you to delete your history. However, if you want your data gone:</p>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Contact the Admin:</strong> Please DM <strong>zudduz</strong> directly on Discord.</li>
    <li><strong>The Process:</strong> We will manually go into the database and scrub your User ID and logs. It might take us a day or two, but we’ll do it.</li>
</ul>

<h3>5. Data Security and Common Sense</h3>
<p>We do not sell your data. We don't share it with advertisers. We are just building cool games.</p>
<ul>
    <li><strong>However:</strong> This is a hobbyist/indie project. While we take security seriously, we are not Fort Knox. Please do not type sensitive personal information (like passwords, credit card numbers, or your home address) into the game chat. The bots don't need it, and neither do we.</li>
</ul>

<h3>6. Updates</h3>
<p>As we add new features (like that automated delete button), we will update this page and let you know in the <code>#announcements</code> channel on the <a href="https://discord.gg/9pHMzf7WHS">official Chicken Scratch Discord server.</a></p>
